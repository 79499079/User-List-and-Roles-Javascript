# Earnest UI Coding Challenge

Hi!  Thanks for taking part in the Earnest Front end UI coding challenge.  The purpose of this is to see how you might go about solving front end UI problems. You may and are encouraged to utilize any framework/library that you see fit for the job.  Also, if you appreciate clean UI's, you are encouraged clean it up with some CSS; feel free to use a CSS library like Twitter's Bootstrap or Zurb's Foundation.

## Assumptions
Start with an array of plain old javascript objects (representing users) each of which has a name and a list of roles. E.g.:
```
var users = [{ name: 'Alex', roles:['admin','user','custom'] }]
```
Assume each "user" object has a property `name` (string)  and a property `roles` (array)


## Part 1: View array of users
Build a view all users interface. 
Requirements:

- View all current users with their respective roles enumerated.
- Supports any number of "users" in the object

## Part 2: Add/remove users in the array
Build in an add user UI.
Requirements:

- Create a new user with roles
- Add the array of users
- The created user should be visible in the list of users once added
- Ability to remove an existing user from the array

## Part 3: Edit user
Build in a way to edit an existing user.
Requirements:

- Edit name and roles for an existing user in the array
- Save and view in the original view all useres
